# python-slot-machine
A fun and unfair slot machine game made using basic to slightly more advanced python to show an understanding:
methods
looking through, and making, rows and columns
nested list
for loops with anonymous symbol,
use of the splat operator

a BIG thanks to Tech with Tim for the walkthrough and helping me understand
